    "\n",
    "1. Used the third-party package Faker to randomly generate a word. (See: https://pypi.org/project/Faker/)\n",
    "2. Used a dictionary to map the letters of the word to letters found by user or _. Makes updating the values easier.\n",
    "3. Disjointed the if-clause testing for the 'quit' input from the conditional clauses that test for a single letter - which Buraleh calls the 'primary business logic'\n",
    "4. Correctly guessed letter is updated in the if-clause that tests for non-membership of correct inputs.\n",
    "5. Let the user know what the word was in the event that they run out of lives, because not doing so would be cruel."
