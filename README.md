### A Series of Reimplemented Python Mini Projects.

The purpose of this repository is demonstrative, it is to allow the reader to gauge Buraleh's adeptnesss in the Python programming language.

This repository contains a handful of Python projects, courtesy of Connor Milliken and his work "Python Bootcamp" (link: https://github.com/Connor-SM/python_bootcamp). Alongside each of Milliken's projects is a reimplementation by Buraleh, wherein the author utilizes advanced and novel Python idioms and third-party packages to meet the same design objectives in a more efficient and robust manner.

A summary of the more significant changes can be found at the bottom of each project suffixed with "buraleh". The author is grateful to Milliken for his work.
